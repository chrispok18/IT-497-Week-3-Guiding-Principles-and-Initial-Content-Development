## 🌟 Spiritual Progression Portfolio

### My 3 Guiding Principles

1. **Faith That Leads to Action**  
   *Inspired by Elder Kevin G. Brown & 3 Nephi 13:19–22*  
   Faith isn’t just belief—it’s **doing**. Every Ansible playbook or ALB config I deploy is an act of trust that God magnifies effort. This principle drives both my spiritual growth and technical excellence.

2. **Order Brings Peace**  
   *Inspired by D&C 88:119 & Elder Uchtdorf*  
   A clean VPC is like a clean heart—**order invites clarity and revelation**. I structure my code, docs, and discipleship with intention, because reverence lives in the details.

3. **Leadership Through Christlike Service**  
   *Inspired by Elder Stevenson & Elder Rasband*  
   I lead by lifting. Whether mentoring on EC2, supporting my NGO, or helping a teammate, **technical skill means nothing without love**. Disciple leadership = service with pure motives.

## ⚖️ Ethical Dilemma Reflection
> A teammate found backend access to user emails. He wanted to “check for threats.”  
> **My response:** Report it officially. **Skill ≠ permission.**  
> *Elder Stevenson:* Be a peacemaker. *Elder Rasband:* Mercy protects dignity.  
> **Ethical leadership = humility + integrity.**

## 🕊️ Temple/Sacred Reflection
> Sitting in quiet reflection, I saw **Elder Bednar’s rope analogy** come alive:  
> My **spiritual**, **academic**, and **technical** strands are meant to **twist together**.  
> When my eye is single to God’s glory (3 Nephi 13:22), even debugging feels sacred.  
> **Networking needs unity. Automation needs consistency. Security needs stewardship.**  
> This week, I’m weaving tighter—using my skills to bless, not impress.
