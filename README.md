## 🌟 Spiritual Progression Portfolio

### My 3 Guiding Principles

**1. Faith That Leads to Action**  
*Inspired by Elder Kevin G. Brown & 3 Nephi 13:19–22*  
Faith isn’t just belief—it’s doing. Every Ansible playbook, ALB config, or S3 deployment is an act of trust that God magnifies effort. This principle drives both my spiritual growth and technical excellence.

**2. Order Brings Peace**  
*Inspired by D&C 88:119 & Elder Uchtdorf*  
A clean VPC is like a clean heart—order invites clarity and revelation. I structure my code, documentation, and discipleship intentionally because reverence lives in the details.

**3. Leadership Through Christlike Service**  
*Inspired by Elder Stevenson & Elder Rasband*  
I lead by lifting. Mentoring on EC2, supporting my NGO, or helping teammates—technical skill means nothing without love. True leadership = service with pure motives.

### ⚖️ Ethical Dilemma Reflection

During a previous internship, a teammate found backend access to user emails. He wanted to “check for threats.” My response: **Report officially to security supervisor.**  

- Skill ≠ permission  
- Elder Stevenson: Be a peacemaker  
- Elder Rasband: Mercy protects dignity  

**Alternative Solution:**  
Implement a monitoring alert system that flags unusual activity without accessing private messages. This respects policy, protects user data, and allows proactive security.  

**Lesson Learned:** Ethical leadership requires humility, integrity, and respect for privacy.

### 🕊️ Temple / Sacred Reflection

While meditating on Elder Bednar’s rope analogy, I realized my **spiritual, academic, and technical strands are meant to twist together**:

- Networking = unity  
- Automation = consistency  
- Security = stewardship  

When my eye is single to God’s glory (3 Nephi 13:22), even debugging feels sacred. This portfolio is a practice of weaving faith and technology together to bless others.
